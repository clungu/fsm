Automaton implementation in Java
================================

This repository will exemplify a way to implement finite states machines into java.

Using enums makes for a more compact and meaningful implementation of a FSM. You have all the logic in one file and all traversal is painless. You will also have a much more easier debugging experience since the name of the states in which you’ve translated will appear in the debugger ( the variable representing the current state will change its value accordingly, bearing the name of the new state) rather than having to figure out what class you have just jumped to. 

All in all I think it’s a good technique to have in mind.
